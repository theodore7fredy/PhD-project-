This repository provides the description of the PhD project title as **Open Quantum Systems in the Strongly Interacting Regime**


# Open Quantum Systems in the Strongly Interacting Regime

## üìå Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to the study of **open quantum systems in the strongly interacting regime**, as part of a PhD project at the **University of Yaound√© 1**.  
The research explores how strong particle interactions interplay with dissipation and decoherence, leading to emergent quantum behaviors such as novel quantum phases, long-range correlations, and non-Markovian dynamics.

Our approach combines **theoretical modeling**, **advanced numerical simulations**, and **potential experimental validation** with platforms like ultracold atoms, superconducting circuits, and cavity QED systems.

## üéØ Research Objectives
1. **Develop theoretical models** for strongly interacting open quantum systems.  
2. **Investigate dissipative dynamics and steady-state properties**, including non-Markovian effects.  
3. **Identify experimentally testable phenomena** (spectral properties, quantum correlations, relaxation dynamics).  
4. **Explore applications** in quantum technologies (quantum simulators, sensors, thermodynamics, error correction).

## üåç Scientific Context & International Position
- Open quantum systems have been widely studied in **weakly interacting regimes**.  
- The **strong interaction regime** remains largely unexplored and poses unique challenges.  
- Our project aims to **fill this gap**, complementing ongoing work in groups such as:
  - Xiamen University (Prof. Pavlo Dral, dissipative dynamics)  
  - Collaborations with Dr. Arrif Ullah (machine learning for quantum dynamics).  

This positioning strengthens the **international impact** of the project and opens opportunities for collaboration.

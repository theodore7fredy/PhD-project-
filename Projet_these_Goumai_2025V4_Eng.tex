\begin{abstract}
This doctoral project introduces a novel framework for the design of symbiotic quantum agrivoltaic systems, combining advanced non-Markovian quantum dynamics, photonic materials engineering, and ethical artificial intelligence. We develop a unified approach that models cropping under panels as an open quantum system subject to a filtered photonic bath, formalizing for the first time the coherent coupling between excitonic energy transfer (\texttt{EET}) and plant photosynthesis. The methodological architecture integrates \texttt{Process Tensor-HOPS} and \texttt{Stochastically Bundled Dissipators} to enable realistic mesoscale quantum simulation, coupled to a generative AI pipeline for the design of non-toxic and biodegradable organic photovoltaic (\texttt{OPV}) materials. The project establishes an open-source quantum software ecosystem, \texttt{AgroQuantPV Suite}, and experimentally demonstrates the simultaneous optimization of energy output (\texttt{PCE} > \SI{20}{\percent}) and agricultural performance (\texttt{ETR\_{rel}} > \SI{90}{\percent}) via adaptive spectral control. The impact is quantified across eleven Sustainable Development Goals, with a valorization pathway through the \texttt{AgroQuantum Technologies} spin-off targeting a levelized cost of energy (\texttt{LCOE}) of \SI{0.04}{\dollar\per\kilo\watt\hour}.

\section{Background, state of the art, and project positioning}

The global energy transition requires photovoltaic conversion technologies that are not only efficient but also sustainable and integrated with existing ecosystems. At the core of these technologies, charge-transport and charge-separation processes are governed by complex quantum dynamics strongly coupled to a thermo-vibrational environment \cite{ye2012, mohs2008}. This project is positioned at the intersection of quantum physics, materials science, and agronomy, within the emerging field of \textbf{Quantum Energy Science} \cite{Metzler2023}. The goal is to harness non-classical quantum effects to catalyze disruptive performance gains in solar technologies.

The 2024–2025 state of the art is marked by significant advances that redefine the boundaries of simulation and materials design:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Process Tensor} methods are emerging as a formally exact solution for modeling non-Markovian quantum memory, surpassing the limitations of traditional hierarchical approaches \cite{keeling2025}.

  \item \textbf{Stochastically Bundled Dissipators} offer a promising route to drastically reduce the cost of simulating Lindblad dynamics for very large systems \cite{Adhikari2025}.

  \item \textbf{3D multi-layer architectures} for solar collection enable unprecedented spectral optimization, opening the way to high value-added applications \cite{shi2025a}.

  \item \textbf{Additive manufacturing (3D printing)} of OPV materials has reached a maturity that enables large-scale, local, and lower-cost production \cite{ju2025}.

  \item \textbf{Quantum software ecosystems} are beginning to integrate the entire value chain, from fundamental computation to industrial applications, fostering a hardware–software co-design approach \cite{basermann2024}.
\end{itemize}

In response to these advances, this project proposes to take a further step by integrating them within a holistic vision: \textbf{next-generation quantum agrivoltaics}. The aim is to mobilize these cutting-edge tools not merely to improve a single component, but to design a symbiotic system in which clean energy production and food security mutually reinforce each other. The objective is to create transparent, spectrally selective, economically viable, and socially responsible agrivoltaic systems, as illustrated in \Cref{fig_agrivoltaic_3d}.

\section{Thesis objectives: A holistic approach}

The project adopts a systemic view of sustainable technology development. Objectives are structured into three complementary axes, integrating technical refinements to ensure robustness and impact of the results.

\subsection{Axis 1: Innovations in quantum dynamics and modeling of symbiotic coupling}

This axis aims to develop a theoretical and computational framework capable of modeling, with unprecedented accuracy, the quantum dynamics of the coupling between excitonic energy (EET) in OPV materials and plant photosynthesis.

\subsubsection{Characterizing vibronic non-classicality as a driver of efficiency}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Diagnosing non-classicality.} Quantify the non-classical nature of collective vibrational modes by incorporating advanced quantum diagnostics into the simulations, such as computing the \textbf{Mandel Q parameter} and the \textbf{Wigner quasi-probability distribution}.

    \item \textbf{Correlation with symbiotic performance.} Establish a direct correlation between the presence of vibronic non-classicality and the overall symbiotic efficiency (SPCE), to test the hypothesis that such quantum fluctuations are a key mechanism for energy optimization.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{High-fidelity simulation of structured thermal baths}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Handling ultra-fast bath modes.} Implement and validate \textbf{Low-Temperature Correction (LTC)} techniques within the \texttt{HOPS} methodology. This approach will effectively treat Matsubara modes—crucial for spectroscopic benchmarks at \SI{77}{\kelvin}—while reducing computational cost without sacrificing accuracy.

    \item \textbf{Coupling beyond the point-dipole approximation.} Go beyond the ideal-dipole approximation (IDA) by systematically using the \textbf{Transition Density Cube (TDC)} method for intermolecular coupling ($J_{mn}$), ensuring accurate short-range interaction descriptions (\SI{<30}{\angstrom}) in OPV aggregates.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Scalability to multi-excitation systems}
\begin{itemize}
\item Validate the Stochastically Bundled Dissipators (SBD) approach in the non-Markovian regime and exploit \texttt{MesoHOPS} scaling to address the challenge of double-excitation and charge-transfer states.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Axis 2: 3D architecture and quantum sensors}

\subsubsection{Optimizing productive vibronic coherences}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spectral filtering for symbiosis.} Model the total transmittance $T_{\text{total}}(\omega) = \prod_{i=1}^N T_i(\omega, z_i)$ to identify quasi-resonances between excitonic transitions and functional vibrational modes, thereby maximizing vibration-assisted energy transfer.

    \item \textbf{Predictive canopy modeling.} Couple spectral-transmittance simulation to agronomic models (e.g., DSSAT) to predict the vertical ETR profile and optimize the energy–biomass trade-off.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Probing system–environment quantum correlations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NV-center sensors for entanglement.} Steer the use of NV-diamond sensors toward detecting robust signatures of quantum correlations such as negativity (entanglement) between excitons and relevant vibrational modes.

    \item \textbf{3D monitoring of the photosynthetic response.} Deploy a multi-height sensor network to map the canopy response in 3D (e.g., non-photochemical quenching, NPQ) under the modulated light environment.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Axis 3: Ethical AI and predictive modeling for eco-design}

This axis focuses on developing an AI pipeline to accelerate the discovery of OPV materials that are non-toxic, biodegradable, and high-performance.

\subsubsection{Developing an AI-assisted quantum dynamics framework (AI-QD)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adopting a non-recursive approach.} Develop an AI framework based on \textbf{trajectory learning} to directly predict the full time evolution of the density matrix $\rho(t)$ as a function of system parameters. This non-recursive approach will massively accelerate screening by avoiding step-by-step propagation.

    \item \textbf{AI-based force-field parametrization.} Use active learning algorithms (e.g., Gaussian Process Regression) to efficiently parametrize the force fields used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, ensuring high-quality structural inputs (spectral densities $J(\omega, T)$) for the quantum model.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Multi-objective optimization and materials engineering}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enhancing molecular descriptors.} Integrate \textbf{surface Electrostatic Potential (ESP)} analysis as a key descriptor in the AI pipeline. ESP will be used to predict molecular alignment and maximize the driving force for exciton dissociation.

    \item \textbf{Targeting key performance metrics.} Set the AI objective to discover materials with properties optimal for a PCE \SI{>20}{\percent}, namely \textbf{balanced and high charge-carrier mobilities} ($\mu_h \approx \mu_e \geq \SI{e-3}{\centi\meter\squared\per\volt\per\second}$) and a \textbf{low non-geminate recombination rate} ($k \leq \SI{e-12}{\centi\meter\cubed\per\second}$).
\end{itemize}

\section{Theoretical and methodological framework}

The methodology is an integrated loop combining multi-scale simulation, artificial intelligence, and experimental validation. This virtuous cycle, illustrated in \Cref{fig_workflow_methodo}, ensures that theoretical predictions are continuously confronted with field reality, while machine learning accelerates exploration of the materials design space.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\caption{Conceptual diagram of the integrated methodological workflow. The cycle starts from \textit{ab initio} calculations (1) to parametrize the quantum system (2). Dynamics is then simulated (3) to compute observables (4) that are compared with experimental data (6). These data feed AI models (5) that optimize the search for new materials, guiding both future calculations (active learning) and final design.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Methodological innovations in multi-scale quantum dynamics}

\subsubsection{Hybrid architecture: Process \texttt{Tensor-HOPS-MesoHOPS}}

Our methodological approach relies on a coherent integration of state-of-the-art quantum methods to capture the richness of non-Markovian dynamics in complex agrivoltaic systems.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Process Tensor for non-Markovian memory.} 
    \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{K}_{\text{PT}}(t,s) = \sum_{k=1}^{N_{\text{modes}}} g_k(t) f_k(s) e^{-\lambda_k |t-s|} + \mathcal{K}_{\text{non-exp}}(t,s).
    \end{equation}
    with Padé-pole decomposition for non-exponential components, enabling a faithful description of long-time temporal correlations.

    To improve low-temperature performance (\SI{77}{\kelvin}), we will incorporate a low-temperature correction (LTC) into the process-tensor calculation. This entails modifying the bath-correlation function to include an effective integration of low-temperature noise, thereby reducing computational cost without sacrificing accuracy.
    
    \item \textbf{MesoHOPS extension for the mesoscale.}
    \begin{equation}
    \pdv{t} \psi_{\mathbf{n}} = -i\mathtt{H}_{\text{eff}}\psi_{\mathbf{n}} + \sum_{k=1}^K n_k\gamma_k\psi_{\mathbf{n}} + \sum_{k=1}^K \sqrt{(n_k+1)|\gamma_k|} \mathtt{L}_k\psi_{\mathbf{n}+\mathbf{e}_k}.
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Adaptive hybridization scheme.} Dynamic switching between \texttt{Process Tensor} and \texttt{MesoHOPS} based on the effective correlation time $\tau_c^{\text{eff}}$ and system size, optimizing the accuracy–cost trade-off.
\end{itemize}

    \begin{equation}
    J(\omega, T) = J_0(\omega)\left[1 + \frac{2}{\exp(\hbar\omega/k_B T) - 1}\right] + J_{\text{low-freq}}(\omega, T),
    \end{equation}
    explicitly modeling thermal effects under agrivoltaic operating conditions (\SIrange{277}{310}{\kelvin}).
    
    \item \textbf{Stochastic modeling of heterogeneities.} Gaussian random fields for energetic disorder with spatial correlations derived from \texttt{AIMD} analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Unified two-tier bath formalism}

For a realistic description of complex biomimetic environments, we adopt a two-tier bath model:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inner bath.} Quasi-exact treatment of structured vibrational modes (e.g., \SI{<200}{\per\centi\meter}) via inclusion in the system Hamiltonian or \texttt{MCTDH-X} methods.
    
    \item \textbf{Outer bath.} Modeling the dissipative continuum as a Gaussian bath derived from \texttt{AIMD}, preserving environmental memory effects.
    
    \item \textbf{Dynamic disorder.} Modeling with explicit temporal correlation $\langle \delta \varepsilon_i(t) \delta \varepsilon_j(0) \rangle = \sigma^2 e^{-|t|/\tau_c}$, where $\tau_c \sim \SI{100}{\femto\second}$ is extracted from \texttt{AIMD}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stochastically bundled dissipators and quantum validation}

\subsubsection{Optimizing operator clustering}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spectral clustering of operators.} Partitioning Lindblad operators based on structural and energetic similarity:
    \begin{equation}
    \mathtt{L}_k^{\text{bundle}} = \sum_{j \in C_k} w_j(T) \mathtt{L}_j, \quad w_j(T) = \frac{\|\mathcal{D}[\mathtt{L}_j]\|_2}{\sum_{m\in C_k} \|\mathcal{D}[\mathtt{L}_m]\|_2}.
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Adaptive error control.} Real-time estimation of truncation error and dynamic adjustment of the number of bundles, ensuring controlled accuracy with a \SI{40}{\percent} cost reduction.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Validation on NISQ quantum processors}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{HEOM implementation on qubits.} Use the algorithm of Dan et al. (2024) for cross-validation on \texttt{IBMQ} quantum processors, establishing a quantum benchmark for classical simulations.
    
    \item \textbf{Quantum fidelity metrics.} Compute fidelity $F(\rho_{\text{PT}}, \rho_{\text{NISQ}})$ for a rigorous assessment of approximate methods.
\end{itemize}

\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathtt{H}_{\text{PSU}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{Chl}}} \varepsilon_i a_i^\dagger a_i + \sum_{i\neq j} J_{ij} a_i^\dagger a_j$ models Photosystem II.

    \item $\mathtt{V}_{\text{spectral}} = \int \dd{\omega} T_{\text{quant}}(\omega) \otimes B_{\text{light}}(\omega)$ describes coherent spectral filtering.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Quantum transfer function}

\begin{equation}
T_{\text{quant}}(\omega) = \sum_{n,m} \frac{\langle n | \mu | m \rangle \langle m | \mu | n \rangle}{\omega - (E_m - E_n) + i\Gamma_{mn}} \cdot F_{\text{coh}}(T, \tau_{\text{decay}}).

    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Quantum synergy index.}
    \begin{equation}

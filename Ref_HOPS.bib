  abstract  = {The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the reduction in transfer caused by static disorder, white noise, and finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.},

  abstract  = {Quantum computing offers promising new avenues for tackling the long-standing challenge of simulating the quantum dynamics of complex chemical systems, particularly open quantum systems coupled to external baths. However, simulating such nonunitary dynamics on quantum computers is challenging since quantum circuits are specifically designed to carry out unitary transformations. Furthermore, chemical systems are often strongly coupled to the surrounding environment, rendering the dynamics non-Markovian and beyond the scope of Markovian quantum master equations like Lindblad or Redfield. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm designed to simulate non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. Our approach enables the implementation of arbitrary quantum master equations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We illustrate the method as applied in conjunction with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method. The effectiveness of the resulting quantum HEOM algorithm is demonstrated as applied to simulations of the non-Lindbladian electronic energy and charge transfer dynamics in models of the carotenoid-porphyrin-C60 molecular triad dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex.},

This paper reviews several examples of biological processes where quantum effects might play a notable role. Initially, the photon capture mechanism present in vision is discussed, where the energy of the photon is used to cause conformational changes to chromophoric proteins. The second example elaborates the highly efficient energy transfer process present in photosynthesis and discusses, in particular, how the random quantum walk process may enhance the performance drastically. Subsequently, the vertebrate magnetoreception, and the possible associated role of the radical pair mechanism in the process is considered. The review concludes with the discussion of some speculative ideas of putative quantum effects arising in neural processes.},

The model under consideration is a noninteracting bosonic chain subject to thermal baths of differing temperature at its boundaries and dephasing noise which is applied uniformly to all the sites. It is shown that the steady-state current may vary nonmonotonically and has a peak for a finite a depending on the position of the cold bath. This site-specific behaviour stems back to the interference effect caused by the parity of the total sites N and the baths positions. The fractional nature of the system, along with the interplay between coherent and incoherent transport, will affect the steady state current that characterizes the transport.},

In this contribution, we present a general approach for the simulation of the optical response of multichromophore systems in a structured environment and its implementation as a quantum algorithm. A key step of the procedure is the pseudomode embedding of the system-environment problem resulting in a finite set of quantum states evolving according to a Markovian quantum master equation. This formulation is then solved by a collision model integrated into a quantum algorithm designed to simulate linear and nonlinear response functions. The workflow is validated by simulating spectra for the prototypical excitonic dimer interacting with fast (memoryless) and finite-memory environments. The results demonstrate, on the one hand, the potential of the pseudomode embedding for simulating the dynamical features of nonlinear spectroscopy, including lineshape, spectral diffusion, and relaxations along delay times. On the other hand, the explicit synthesis of quantum circuits provides a fully quantum simulation protocol of nonlinear spectroscopy harnessing the efficient quantum simulation of many-body dynamics promised by the future generation of fault-tolerant quantum computers.},

Utilizing the quantum optical open system master equation approach for the collective dipole dynamics, we demonstrate that, depending on the system parameters, our bio-mimicked 3D ring enables efficient excitation transfer between two ring layers.

The stochastic dissipator maintains the Lindblad form, ensuring completely positive and trace-preserving dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by considering a Morse oscillator coupled to a spin bath. Our numerical experiments show that a small number of stochastically bundled operators can accurately capture the system’s dynamics, even when the Hilbert space dimension is large. This method offers a new perspective on open quantum systems and provides a computationally efficient way to simulate their dynamics.},

Here, we intruduce a new formula by combining the density matrix of the Liouville-Master Equation simulating quantum transport in nanoscale devices, and the phenomenological model of electronic conductance through molecules, that can account for the observed distance- and temperature dependence of conductance in proteins. We demonstrate its efficacy on experimentally highly conductive extracellular cytochrome nanowires, which are good candidates to illustrate our new approach by calculating and visualizing their electronic wiring, given the interest in the arrangement of their conducting and insulating parts.

In the present work, we show that this resonant behavior survives if we take into account the vibrational degrees of freedom as well. After giving a summary of the basic formalism of chemical reactions we show that resonant electron transfer can be assisted by vibrations. We find the condition for this efficient transfer and show that in the case of additional interaction with noise, a distinct non-Arrhenius behavior develops that is markedly different from the usual Kramers-like activated transfer.},

In this letter, we delve into the foundational aspects of environment-induced SSQC, shedding light on its emergence within the framework of system-bath interactions. Starting from a microscopic system-bath coupled model, we investigate the dependence of SSQC on environmental memory effects, bath temperature, system-bath coupling strength, and squeezing parameters. Our findings reveal that the environment not only acts as a generator but also as a disruptor of SSQC. A peak will exist for a non-Markovian bath, which is a result of competition between these two mechanisms. Interestingly, the peak disappears in Markovian case. Additionally, we observe that the generated SSQC can be further amplified through environment squeezing.},

  abstract  = {Fluctuations in energy gap and coupling constants between chromophores can play an important role in absorption and energy transfer across a collection of two-level systems. In photosynthesis, light-induced quantum coherence can affect the efficiency of energy transfer to the designated "trap" state. Theoretically, the interplay between fluctuations and coherence has been studied often, employing either a Markovian or a perturbative approximation. In this study, we depart from these approaches to incorporate memory effects by using Kubo's quantum stochastic Liouville equation. We introduce the effects of decay of the created excitation (to the ground state) on the desired propagation and trapping that provides a direction of flow of the excitation. In the presence of light-induced pumping, we establish a relation between the efficiency, the mean survival time, and the correlation decay time of the bath-induced fluctuations. A decrease in the steady-state coherence during the transition from the non-Markovian regime to the Markovian limit results in a decrease in efficiency. As in the well-known Haken-Strobl model, the ratio of the square of fluctuation strength to the rate plays a critical role in determining the mechanism of energy transfer and in shaping the characteristics of the efficiency profile. We recover a connection between the transfer flux and the imaginary part of coherences in both equilibrium and excited bath states, in both correlated and uncorrelated bath models. We uncover a non-monotonic dependence of efficiency on site energy heterogeneity for both correlated and uncorrelated bath models.},

This chapter takes an important step in this direction: It presents scientific considerations essential for building a quantum software ecosystem that makes quantum computing available for scientific and industrial problem solving. Central to this discourse is the concept of hardware-software co-design, which fosters a bidirectional feedback loop from the application layer at the top of the software stack down to the hardware. This approach begins with compilers and low-level software that are specifically designed to align with the unique specifications and constraints of the quantum processor, proceeds with algorithms developed with a clear understanding of underlying hardware and computational model features, and extends to applications that effectively leverage the capabilities to achieve a quantum advantage. We analyze the ecosystem from two critical perspectives: the conceptual view, focusing on theoretical foundations, and the technical infrastructure, addressing practical implementations around real quantum devices necessary for a functional ecosystem. This approach ensures that the focus is towards promising applications with optimized algorithm-circuit synergy, while ensuring a user-friendly design, an effective data management and an overall orchestration. Our chapter thus offers a guide to the essential concepts and practical strategies necessary for developing a scientifically grounded quantum software ecosystem.},

We demonstrate that the rate of energy extraction is optimized under conditions that minimize the quantum coherence and entanglement of the system, which is a consequence of spontaneous parity time-reversal symmetry breaking. We then examine the effects of vibrational disorder and show that dephasing can be used to enhance the transport of delocalized excitations in settings relevant to biological photosynthesis.

  abstract  = {The theory of open quantum systems has many applications ranging from simulating quantum dynamics in condensed phases to better understanding quantum-enabled technologies. At the center of theoretical chemistry are the developments of methodologies and computational tools for simulating charge and excitation energy transfer in solutions, biomolecules, and molecular aggregates. As a variety of these processes display non-Markovian behavior, classical computer simulation can be challenging due to exponential scaling with existing methods. With quantum computers holding the promise of efficient quantum simulations, in this paper, we present a new quantum algorithm based on Kraus operators that capture the exact non-Markovian effect at a finite temperature. The implementation of the Kraus operators on the quantum machine uses a combination of singular value decomposition (SVD) and optimal Walsh operators that result in shallow circuits. We demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm by simulating the spin-boson dynamics and the exciton transfer in the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) complex. The NISQ results show very good agreement with the exact ones.},

  abstract  = {Background The expression of biological traits is modulated by genetics as well as the environment, and the level of influence exerted by the latter may vary across characteristics. Photosynthetic traits in plants are complex quantitative traits that are regulated by both endogenous genetic factors and external environmental factors such as light intensity and CO_2 concentration. The specific processes impacted occur dynamically and continuously as the growth of plants changes. Although studies have been conducted to explore the genetic regulatory mechanisms of individual photosynthetic traits or to evaluate the effects of certain environmental variables on photosynthetic traits, the systematic impact of environmental variables on the dynamic process of integrated plant growth and development has not been fully elucidated. Results In this paper, we proposed a research framework to investigate the genetic mechanism of high-dimensional complex photosynthetic traits in response to the light environment at the genome level. We established a set of high-dimensional equations incorporating environmental regulators to integrate functional mapping and dynamic screening of gene‒environment complex systems to elucidate the process and pattern of intrinsic genetic regulatory mechanisms of three types of photosynthetic phenotypes of Populus simonii that varied with light intensity. Furthermore, a network structure was established to elucidate the crosstalk among significant QTLs that regulate photosynthetic phenotypic systems. Additionally, the detection of key QTLs governing the response of multiple phenotypes to the light environment, coupled with the intrinsic differences in genotype expression, provides valuable insights into the regulatory mechanisms that drive the transition of photosynthetic activity and photoprotection in the face of varying light intensity gradients. Conclusions This paper offers a comprehensive approach to unraveling the genetic architecture of multidimensional variations in photosynthetic phenotypes, considering the combined impact of integrated environmental factors from multiple perspectives.},

Since the Floquet-Lindblad formalism encapsulates the entire information regarding the NESS, it in principle enables us to obtain non-linear effects to all orders at once. The Floquet-Lindblad formalism thus provides a powerful tool for studying driven-dissipative solid-state systems, which we illustrate by deriving the nonlinear optical response of a simple two-band model of an insulating solid and comparing it with prior results established through Keldysh techniques.},

Such energy transport processes can be investigated as open quantum systems that blend the quantum coherence and environmental noise, and have been experimentally simulated on a few quantum devices. However, the existing experiments always lack a solid quantum simulation for the FMO energy transport due to their constraints to map a variety of issues in actual FMO complexes that have rich biological meanings. Here we successfully map the full coupling profile of the seven-site FMO structure by comprehensive characterisation and precise control of the evanescent coupling of the three-dimensional waveguide array. By applying a stochastic dynamical modulation on each waveguide, we introduce the base site energy and the dephasing term in coloured noise to faithfully simulate the power spectral density of the FMO complexes. We show our photonic model well interprets the phenomena including reorganisation energy, vibrational assistance, exciton transfer and energy localisation. We further experimentally demonstrate the existence of an optimal transport efficiency at certain dephasing strength, providing a window to closely investigate environment-assisted quantum transport.},

Given the distinct features of donor and acceptor materials, designing solid additives to selectively control the aggregation behaviors of them represents a key strategy for further development of OSCs. Herein, a series of bithiophene isomers solid additives (2,2-TT, 2,3-TT, and 3,3-TT) are designed for film morphology regulation. Systematic analysis reveals that the addition of 2,2-TT significantly enhances the π-π stacking of L8-BO, yet exerts a relatively limited effect on PM6 aggregation. Conversely, the incorporation of 3,3-TT not only facilitates the formation of compact and highly ordered molecular packing of L8-BO but also substantially promote the denser π-π stacking of PM6. Consequently, the PM6:L8-BO-based OSCs with 3,3-TT treatment achieve a higher efficiency of 19.34%, benefitting from the balanced charge mobility and longer carrier lifetime. More impressively, the D18:L8-BO-based devices treated with 3,3-TT deliver a remarkable efficiency of 20.32%, with an excellent fill factor of 82.47%, which ranks among the best values reported so far. This work highlights the critical role of the solid additive isomerization strategy in selectively regulating the aggregation characteristics of donor and acceptor materials, thereby facilitating the further advancement of OSCs field.},

  abstract  = {Abstract A highly stable molecular radical cation (RC) derived from ethylenedioxy thiophene (EDOT) is effectively utilized for the p‐doping of poly‐3‐hexylthiophene (P3HT), an organic semiconductor. The success of this process is due to efficient electron transfer from the highest occupied molecular orbital band of P3HT to the singly unoccupied molecular orbital of the radical cation species. Confirmation of the doping is experimentally confirmed through UV–vis‐NIR absorption spectroscopy and electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The ability to dope the conjugated polymers PBTTT and PTB7 is also spectroscopically confirmed. An increase in work‐function of P3HT upon doping is observed due to electron transfer from P3HT to the radical cation with a concomitant decrease in the Fermi energy of P3HT. Impedance and four point probe analysis showed that the doped polymer films exhibited a significant decrease in resistance compared to the pristine films. This work presents the first use of a stable, easily synthesized EDOT‐based radical cation as a molecular p‐dopant for conjugated polymers, offering a novel and broadly applicable alternative to traditional dopants such as F4TCNQ.},

  abstract = {The performance of optoelectronic materials has been booming developed. Yet, the traditional solar cell manufacturing techniques, such as spin coating and screen printing, have significant limitations that seem to hinder the further development of solar cell technology. Compared with traditional manufacturing processes, additive manufacturing (AM) boasts advantages such as flexibility in the printing process, precise control over material deposition, and simpler procedures. These features provide a foundation for further enhancing solar cell performance and expanding their applications. This review outlines the superiority of AM compared with traditional solar cell manufacturing methods and highlights how AM has addressed specific challenges currently faced by solar cells. The most widely researched solar cell structures in recent years were briefly reviewed with summarizing their advantages and disadvantages. Then, a comprehensive overview of different manufacturing processes, including traditional printing methods and AM, is presented. Especially, their workflows, characteristics, and impressive innovative applications in solar cell manufacturing were discussed in detail. Finally, based on the current state of research, the review reflects on the future prospects of applying AM technology in space solar energy production, such as integrated printing with protective outer layers together with the solar cells, customized functional structure printing, flexible large‐scale printing, and printing of high‐performance novel materials with nanoscale and microscale structures.image},

  abstract  = {Although photovoltaic (PV) solar cells have been widely used for a variety of applications, several critical issues are yet to be addressed, including further enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) and their 2D solar harvesting with limited land availability. It has been reported that traditional PV installations require approximately 22,000 square miles to power the entire United States—posing a significant barrier, particularly in urban and agricultural settings. A unique dual modality of PV system has been proposed and implemented for both power generation and crop photosynthesis, namely, agrivoltaics. This system installs PV panels over the crops while harvesting solar for PV electricity generation and, at the same time, integrates with crop cultivation, which is a promising solution to optimize land utilization. However, for opaque PV panels, sunlight is often obstructed, potentially impacting plant growth and yield. To address this critical issue, a 3D solar harvesting concept has been proposed and experimentally investigated. By placing multiple layers of transparent PV panels parallel, sunlight can penetrate multiple layers and generate electricity on each PV, significantly enhancing the solar harvesting surface area. Most importantly, sunlight can also be collected by the crops underneath for effective photosynthesis. Among various PV materials, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using porphyrin-based dyes have demonstrated potential for spectral modulation, optimizing both electricity generation and crop illumination. This review focuses on a novel approach to a 3D solar harvesting system via a multi-layered PV architecture for agrivoltaics. Also discussed are the current challenges in agrivoltaics, spectral selective mechanisms, and 3D solar harvesting architecture that show promise for sustainable energy production and land-efficient solar power deployment.},
